# Color Palette Search
Repository for a searching page for a color palette in an external data base

## What's this project about?
This project is about creating a Searching page using Bootstrap and React.

## How to Run: 
- Get sure you download two files:
   ·  standalone.html
   ·  colorPaletteSearch.jsx
- The standalone.html file is where the Bootstrap and React libraries will be linked for the app to work.
- In the colorPaletteSearch.jsx is where the app will be constructed and the data will be fetched.
- Open a command line on your computer and run the command cd path/to/project/root, which allows you to point to the root folder of the starter files (note that path/to/project/root should be replaced with the actual path to the directory where you saved the files)
- Within the same command-line window, run npm install to install all dependencies
- Once the command completes successfully, run npm start to start the application in your browser
- Also, you may need a local server to test the application, so in the terminal, in the directory where you save these files, run the command "npx serve" to get you own http server, which is commonly the http://localhost:3000/ server.
  
## What's next?
There are plenty on new features that can be added to this searching type page, so it can be adapted to the use case you want.
- Adapt and change the style for the type of information that will be retrieved
- Add tools t the browser so the user can also adapt it to its own needs, like the number of results wanted to be render in each page, or add filters to make the search more specific.
- Change the data base from where the information will be fetched.
